# ErLisp

Simple Lisp interpreter.

## ErLisp and the Lisp family

This language is heavily inspired by Emacs Lisp, chosen as a simple
and straightforward Lisp implementation.  In particular, the main
source for ErLisp are very early Emacs versions, particularly Emacs 16
(rms, 1985).

Emacs Lisp is obviously not the most production-grade Lisp, but this
came out also from love for Emacs and from study of its sources.

Another inspiration source was GNU Guile.
